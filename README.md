<!-- ## Abastract -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper proposes the **RD++** approach for anomaly detection by enriching feature compactness and suppressing anomalous signals through a multi-task learning design. For the feature compactness task, RD++ introduces the self-supervised optimal transport method. For the anomalous signal suppression task, RD++ simulates pseudo-abnormal samples with simplex noise and minimizes the reconstruction loss. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RD++ achieves a **new state-of-the-art benchmark** on the challenging MVTec dataset for both anomaly detection and localization. **More importantly**, when compared to recent SOTA methods, RD++ runs **6.x times faster than PatchCore** and **2.x times faster than CFA**, while introducing a negligible latency compared to RD.

## Libraries 
```       
- geomloss
- numba
```

or (preferably whithin a fresh env to avoid conflicts):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data Preparations
Download MVTEC dataset from [[Link]](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad)

## Train
To train and test the RD++ method on 15 classes of MVTEC, for example, with two classes: carpet and leather, please run:
```bash
python main.py --save_folder RD++  \
               --classes carpet leather

```
## Evaluation
If you only need to perform inference with checkpoints, please run:
```bash
python inference.py --checkpoint_folder RD++  \
                    --classes carpet leather
```
